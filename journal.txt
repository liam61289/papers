Title:
Model-Measurement intercomparison of biogenic SOA in West Africa

Introduction:
In this paper we present measurements of aerosol particles made over forests in West Africa.
Chemical composition and mass concentrations were measured using AMS (Allen et al 2004).
Smith et al 2007 made measurements in this region, and while they were great, we need more in order to asnwer questions they were unable to address.

Simulations:
We present here simulations of aerosol particle formation, using a chamber model.

Methodology:
We used various particle counters to measure size distributions.  The instruments were described in Green et al 2010.

Results:
We found out some stuff that previously was unknown.
The simulations did a good job of reproducing the measurements.

Conclusions:
We gained valuable insight into the formation processes of SOA from biogenic gases.
Some questions remain unanswered, so give us some more money.

Figures:
This is a draft so all figures are at the end.
